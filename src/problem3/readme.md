- `WalletBalance` interface is missed blockchain type.
- Line 39 using undeclared variable `lhsPriority`.
- Sort method at line 45 missing condition where leftPriority === rightPriority
- Function `getPriority` at line 19 receiving parameter as `any` type.
- Function `getPriority` change from switch case to map, to improve performance.
- Redundant `map` function at line 56, format amount can be invoked inside render function.
- Shouldn't use spread `{...rest}` props, since hard to manage props, can lead to potential bug if pass invalid prop and if props too large can impact performance.
- Can remove useMemo, since filter and sort are not computationally expensive.
- If possible avoid using key by array index.
